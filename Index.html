                education system, which falls under the command of the government at three levels: central, state and
                local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and
                Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to
                children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of the total number of public schools to private schools in
                India is 10:3.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Up until 1976, under the Indian constitution, school education was a
                state subject; states possessed full jurisdiction over making and implementing education policies. After
                the 42nd Amendment of the Constitution of India was passed in 1976, education fell under the concurrent
                list.[8] This allowed the central government to recommend education policies and programmes, even if
                state governments continued to wield extensive autonomy in implementing these programmes.[8] In a
                country as large as India, now with 28 states and eight union territories, this has created vast
                differences between states in terms of their policies, plans, programmes and initiatives relating to
                school education. Periodically, national policy frameworks are created to guide states in their creation
                of state-level programs and policies. State governments and local government bodies manage the majority
                of primary and upper primary schools and the number of government-managed elementary schools is growing.
                Simultaneously the number and proportion managed by private bodies is growing.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Early education in India commenced under the supervision of a guru or
                preceptor after initiation.[34] The education was delivered through Gurukula. The relationship between
                the Guru and his Shishya (students /disciples) was a very important part of education.[35] Takshasila
                (in modern-day Pakistan) is one of the example of ancient higher learning institute in India from
                possibly 8th century BCE, however, it is debatable whether it could be regarded a university or not in
                modern sense, since teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges,
                and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in a Taxila,
                in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India. Nalanda was the oldest university-system
                of education in the world in the modern sense of university. There all subjects were taught in the Pali
                language.
